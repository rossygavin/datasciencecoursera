This repository contains the code to extract, merge and clean up the data for my Getting and Cleaning data project with John Hopkins University through Coursera.

The data used is based on Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones and the information on the initial dataset can be found here:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

In this folder there is the cleaned data set in a csv file called "UCI_HAR_Tidy_Dataset.csv".

There is a file called "run_analysis.R" which contains the script for the processing on the data.

There is also a file called "workbook.md" which describes the processes of the script and the data in the cleaned dataset.
